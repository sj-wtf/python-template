# python-template

A template repository for future Python projects

### Things to update

You'll want to update many fields in (pyproject.toml)[pyproject.toml], the name of the folder (src/packagename)[src/packagename], and the workflow name in (.github/workflows/default.yaml)[.github/workflows/default.yaml]. Update other files as needed, but these will be the immediate changes needed as you create a new Python package.
